# Memory-Game

The game is designed to learn Java Script and consolidate knowledge about HTML and CSS. The project was created and designed by me. The idea was to create a fully functioning and responsive game.

## What I have learned and what obstacles I encountered

This is my first project in which I combined several actions in JavaScript, mixing elements, countdown time, delay action, search for the same elements. In CSS I tried to maximize the use of complex selectors as well as used variables for colors. Creating a fully responsive application was an interesting challenge.
